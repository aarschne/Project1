Which smartphone company (among Google, Motorola, and Apple) is the best investment option for a client? The wanted to answer this question by using an api, Alpha Vantage, to show the net income data for the companies in question and also their daily stock information. Both of the data was obrained for roughly the last five years.

# Brief description of coding
To recreate our data, you would need to first run the stock_api notebook and then the income_api notebook. These output csvs to the resources folder. Then, the plot notebook must be run. It reads in the csvs from the resources folder and does the statistical and graphical analyses. It outputs the graphs to the output folder.
